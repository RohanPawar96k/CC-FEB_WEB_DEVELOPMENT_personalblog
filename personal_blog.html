        <h3>1) Google Bard advert shows new AI search tool making a factual error</h3><br>
        <div>
          <img src="googleApard.jpeg" class="one">
        </div>
        <p>An advert for Google Bard, the tech giant’s experimental conversational AI, inadvertently shows the tool providing a factually inaccurate response to a query 
        It is evidence that the move to use artificial intelligence chatbots like this to provide results for web searches is happening too fast, says Carissa Véliz at the University of Oxford. “The possibilities for creating misinformation on a mass scale are huge,” she says.

        Google announced this week that it was launching an AI called Bard that will be integrated into its search engine after a testing phase, providing users with a bespoke written response to their query rather than a list of relevant websites. Chinese search engine Baidu has also announced plans for a similar project, and on 7 February, Microsoft launched its own AI results service for its Bing search engine.

        <h3>2) Ultrasound illusion could make buttons on a touchscreen feel real</h3><br>
        <div>

        An illusion that uses ultrasound to make touching a flat surface feel like pressing a button could be used to add an extra dimension to touchscreen devices.

        When you press down on a button with your finger, the skin there is stretched by friction, and when the button is released, the friction reduces and the skin relaxes. Exploiting this effect by suddenly changing the friction of a surface using ultrasound can make objects feel different, but it was unclear how this happened or how reliably this effect could be produced.

        Now, Michaël Wiertlewski at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and his colleagues have created a glass plate that can quickly change its friction. It does this with an actuator that releases waves of ultrasound to vibrate the plate.

        <h3>3) Can AI curat better art than human?</h3><br>

        “AI can’t come for creativity because that’s an inherently human act”, says Laura Herman, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. However, the rise of AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Midjourney has questioned whether that is actually true.

        Now, Herman is exploring the ways in which AI can curate art for a public audience, and what potential ramifications there may be on creativity. Her recent exhibition in London entitled The Algorithmic Pedestal invited visitors to explore images curated by artist Fabienne Hess alongside images curated by Instagram’s algorithm. As algorithms infiltrate our visual culture, what impact do they have on how audiences perceive creative content?

        <h3>4) Web3 promise to reclaim the internet from tech-giants will it work</h3><br>

        On a gloomy Thursday morning in Newcastle, UK, I sit with my laptop open playing a game. But I am not, I will admit, having much fun. Besides the occasional pixelated images of a space hero, it is mostly a text-based, multiple-choice offering, with prompts encouraging me to imagine that I am on the planet Veles and asking where I would like to mine next. The experience isn’t enhanced by the fact that I have had to spend 20 minutes linking a cryptocurrency wallet to the game in order to get this far.

        Why am I putting myself through this? Because, believe it or not, this game is supposed to be the future of the internet, or at least part of it. It is one of the world’s top-rated distributed apps, a manifestation of what some see as a shiny new phase of the online realm called web3.
